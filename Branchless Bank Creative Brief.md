# Creative Brief
### Client:  Branchless Bank
### Project Objective:
To create a convenient, user-friendly, humanized App for Branchless Bank members that makes them feel empowered and in control of their finances
### Target Audience: 
Branchless Bank is a bank that targets audiences that typically feel left out by Big commercial banks. It prides itself on providing a customer-focused banking experience to groups that typically feel undervalued by financial institutions. Our target audience includes: women, minorities, non-english speaking customers and younger generations. Branchless is customer-focused rather than revenue-focused and sales-driven. Our goal is to leave members feeling educated and empowered about their finances, and to build a sense of trust between our bank and our customers.   
### Where and how will the end product be used?
Everywhere. Like Branchless, we want this App to be accessible to a diverse population of people and we will offer it for free to be downloaded on any mobile device.  

### How and When will it be completed?
1) conduct research and establish key features that will differentiate the Branchless App from alternative ways of banking
2) Design a user-friendly Interface that adheres to the project obejective keeping the Branchless brand and it's customer-focused mentality intact
3) Create wireframes and submit prototypes as assigned
4) Turn in completed project upon due date

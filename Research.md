# Branchless Bank

 ## Branchless Bank Research 
 ### Background/History
 - Branchless is a new bank that prides itself on being inclusive, empowering its members to be smart about money
 - Unlike big banks that feel like "boys clubs," Branchless is a bank that attracts women, minorities, younger generations and populations that often feel overlooked by the financial industry 
 - Branchless is different kind of bank because it is more customer-focused (doesn't have the upselling, money-driven, corporate, big-bank feel) 
- The Goal of the Branchless App is to offer a different, more user-friendly virtual banking experience 
- Users of this App will be existing bank members with Branchless accounts, and  new or prospecting bank members

### Branchless Personas 
   - The Starter Account-holder
     - Age 18-28
     - maleable, open-minded, fresh 
     - new to banking in general because they're just now earning/spending money without their parent's involvement
     -  More tech-savvy and more likely to be open to using an app for banking transactions
   - The Professional Account-holder
      - Age 29-49
      - busy, career-driven, high expectations for the Branchless customer experience
      - This user will likely have had their own bank account for several years and will use the new app to avoid having to wait in person or on the phone to complete their transactions 
      - Will be concerned with the less personal, and less "secure" experience of virtual banking because they will remember when most transactions had to be done face-to-face or over the phone
      - customer service is important to this member and they want to be rewarded for their loyalty to the bank
      - Open to learning new technology provided it's convenient and easy to use, and still feels like they're receiving a high level of customer service 
      
      
- The Senior User 
     - Age 50+
     - loyal, careful, skeptical of digital transactions 
     - this member is more weary of using an app because of concerns with the learning curve, the security of virtual banking, and the loss of the person-to-person customer experience
     - this person is less concerned with speed and convenience of using an app if it means sacrificing the personal, old-school banking experience

 - Threats
   - losing the "mom and pop," personalized banking experience that attracted customers in the first place
